# Last Ninja RM
 A Creative Common remake of Last Ninja C64 games

## About
The game is made with Godot (4.3), code is mostly C# but there is a littel bit of GDScript and GDShader.
It is done as 3d game with isometric camera projection, and shaders to make it visuals _retro_.
I have no license to do it, so it is just a fan made game, inspired by the original.

Levels will not be the same as the original (but will be inspired by, mostly the locations), gameplay will be very similar.

## Assets
All assets, except music, are created from scratsh or collected from Creative Common (and similar) sources.
In some cases, some assets are paid, they will be explicitely mentioned.
Music right now is using covers of the original songs. This will change in future. (The only music used right now was created by Fast Loaders)

## Contributing
Right now I do not plan to have collaborators, it is just a hobby projects.
I will release a way to create new rooms and export them as packages, so it will be possible to create new levels.
